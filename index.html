                <h3>Minneriya National Park</h3>
                <p> Minneriya National Park is a renowned wildlife sanctuary located in 
                    the North Central Province of Sri Lanka. Covering an area of approximately 
                    8,890 hectares, the park is famous for its vast reservoir, the Minneriya 
                    Tank, which plays a crucial role in attracting a large number of wildlife 
                    species, especially during the dry season. The park is best known for its 
                    spectacular gatherings of wild Asian elephants. During the dry months, 
                    between July and October, a phenomenon called "The Gathering" occurs when 
                    hundreds of elephants congregate around the Minneriya Tank to quench their 
                    thirst and graze on the lush grass that emerges from the receding waters. 
                    This extraordinary sight has become a major attraction and is considered 
                    one of the largest gatherings of Asian elephants in the world. Apart from 
                    elephants, Minneriya National Park is also home to various other wildlife 
                    species, including sambar deer, Sri Lankan axis deer (spotted deer), water 
                    buffalo, Sri Lankan sloth bear, and a wide array of birdlife, making it an 
                    excellent destination for birdwatching enthusiasts. Visitors can explore 
                    the park through organized safari tours, and experienced guides help to spot 
                    and observe the diverse wildlife in their natural habitat. Minneriya National 
                    Park offers a unique opportunity to witness the beauty and biodiversity of 
                    Sri Lanka's wildlife, making it a must-visit destination for nature lovers 
                    and wildlife enthusiasts.

                <h3>Hurulu Eco Park </h3>
                <p> Hurulu Eco Park, also known as Hurulu Forest Reserve, is a significant wildlife 
                    sanctuary located in Sri Lanka's North Central Province, close to the ancient 
                    city of Polonnaruwa. Covering an area of approximately 10,000 hectares, the park 
                    is renowned for its diverse flora and fauna, making it an important ecological 
                    hotspot in the country. The key highlight of Hurulu Eco Park is its population 
                    of wild Asian elephants. It serves as a vital corridor for these majestic creatures 
                    to move between the Wasgamuwa National Park and the Minneriya-Girithale Sanctuary, 
                    especially during the dry season. Like the neighboring Minneriya National Park, 
                    Hurulu Eco Park also witnesses "The Gathering" of elephants during the dry months 
                    when herds come together to find water and food. Apart from elephants, the park is 
                    home to a variety of wildlife, including sambar deer, spotted deer, Sri Lankan axis 
                    deer, water buffalo, wild boars, and a wide range of bird species, making it a popular 
                    destination for birdwatching enthusiasts as well. Visitors can explore the park through 
                    organized jeep safaris conducted by experienced guides. The eco-park offers a fantastic 
                    opportunity to witness the natural beauty of Sri Lanka's wildlife in their natural habitat 
                    and is a must-visit destination for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. It also 
                    contributes significantly to the conservation efforts aimed at protecting the country's 
                    unique biodiversity.

                <h3>Kawudulla National Park </h3>
                <p> Kawudulla National Park is characterized by its diverse landscape, including grasslands, 
                    wetlands, and small lakes, which create a variety of habitats for wildlife. The park is 
                    particularly famous for its large population of wild elephants. During the dry season, 
                    herds of elephants migrate to the park in search of water and food, providing visitors 
                    with an excellent opportunity to witness these magnificent creatures up close. In addition 
                    to elephants, the park is home to several other species of mammals, such as deer, wild boars, 
                    sloth bears, and leopards. It is also a haven for birdwatchers, as a wide range of avian 
                    species can be spotted throughout the year. The remote and tranquil nature of Kawudulla 
                    National Park makes it a less crowded alternative to the nearby Minneriya and Kaudulla 
                    national parks. Visitors can explore the park through guided jeep safaris, which allow 
                    them to experience the untouched wilderness and observe the natural behaviors of Sri Lanka's 
                    wildlife.
